# Reflection Questions
 When do you think you might be able to use Bootstrap in the future? When would you not want to?
 When building a small/brief website project where development time is limited and custom styling is not super important. Probably wouldn not want to use it if it was a design focused project or was concerned about speed (if using bootstrap js). 
 What are some issues/downsides you could run into by using Bootstrap in industry?
 It looks like a lot of other websites which also use it. It may not continue to be updated and supported as browsers, js, html, and css are updated, which could leave your site stranded.
